Core Services of HTH OnlineTest System, an under-graduate group project. 
The code, to be honest, is embarrassingly naive. One may never learn/be inspired from such a project.
However, by releasing this, we are trying to set up a momument for our undergraduate memories. 


*"We don’t have to be nostalgic for the so-called good old days. Life in those days was dangerous and confusing. But we shouldn’t be depressed about today, either. Because today will one day be referred to as the good old days."*

*"People really were stupid in the past, and they really had a tough time."*
